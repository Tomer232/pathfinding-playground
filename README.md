# Pathfinding Visualization Game

## Why I Built This Project
I created this project to expand my knowledge of Python and algorithms. As a final-year Computer Science student, I aim to enhance my proficiency with Python and Excel usage. I also enjoy translating complex ideas into visual formats, making them easier to understand.

I chose to include the BI-RRT* algorithm because I want to familiarize myself with it, as it will play a significant role in my final year project.

## Algorithms Included
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- A* Search (A*)
- Bidirectional Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (BI-RRT*)

## Libraries Used
- **pygame**: For graphics and interactive elements.
- **openpyxl**: For managing Excel files to store metadata.

## User Interface
- A simple grid where algorithms are visualized in real-time.
- Button panel for easy control and algorithm selection.
